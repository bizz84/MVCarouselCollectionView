## Preview

![MVCarouselCollectionView preview](https://github.com/bizz84/MVCarouselCollectionView/raw/master/preview.gif "MVCarouselCollectionView preview")

## Features

- Horizontal-scrolling carousel with pinch & zoom capabilities
- Synchronous or asynchronous image loading (works with local or remote images)
- Embedded or full-screen mode

## Installation

If you are using CocoaPods, simply add the line below to your Podfile, then type 'pod install':

<pre>
pod 'MVCarouselCollectionView'
</pre>

Alternatively, you can install this as a git submodule by following these steps:

* git submodule add https://github.com/bizz84/MVCarouselCollectionView.git
* Drag the MVCarouselCollectionView.xcodeproj file into your Xcode project (Xcode will ask to create a workspace file if your project does not have one already)
* Under the main app target, open the **General tab** and add MVCarouselCollectionView under the **Embedded Binaries** section
* Build the MVCarouselCollectionView target

## Usage

Below is a sample implementation of a view controller using MVCarouselCollectionView. See the demo application for a more advanced usage example.

```swift
import MVCarouselCollectionView

class CarouselViewController: UIViewController, MVCarouselCollectionViewDelegate {

    // Local images
    let imagePaths = [ "image1.png", "image2.png", "image3.png" ]
    // Closure to load local images with UIImage.named
    let imageLoader: ((imageView: UIImageView, imagePath : String, completion: (newImage: Bool) -> ()) -> ()) = {
      (imageView: UIImageView, imagePath : String, completion: (newImage: Bool) -> ()) in

        imageView.image = UIImage(named:imagePath)
        completion(newImage: imageView.image != nil)
    }

    @IBOutlet var collectionView : MVCarouselCollectionView!

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        configureCollectionView()
    }

    func configureCollectionView() {
    
        // NOTE: the collectionView IBOutlet class must be declared as MVCarouselCollectionView in Interface Builder, otherwise this will crash.
        collectionView.selectDelegate = self
        collectionView.imagePaths = imagePaths
        collectionView.commonImageLoader = self.imageLoader
        collectionView.maximumZoom = 2.0
        collectionView.reloadData()
    }
    // MARK:  MVCarouselCollectionViewDelegate
    func carousel(carousel: MVCarouselCollectionView, didSelectCellAtIndexPath indexPath: NSIndexPath) {

        // Do something with cell selection
    }
    
    func carousel(carousel: MVCarouselCollectionView, didScrollToCellAtIndex cellIndex : NSInteger) {

        // Page changed, can use this to update page control
    }
}
```

## Configuration
MVCarouselCollectionView was designed to be used with paging enabled. Please ensure the following properties are set:

* Paging Enabled = true
* Min spacing between cells = 0
* Min spacing between lines = 0

## Known issues
The demo app is only known to work well in portrait mode. Interface rotation / size classes changes are not properly supported.

## Requirements
- MVCarouselCollectionView is compatible with Swift 2.0 and was tested under Xcode 7.2. 
- iOS 8.0 or greater is supported.
- For Swift 1.2 / Xcode 6.x support, please use the older pod: ```pod 'MVCarouselCollectionView', '1.0.5'```
